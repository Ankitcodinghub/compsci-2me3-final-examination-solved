Question 1&nbsp; What are the problems with using ‚Äúaverage lines of code written per day‚Äù as a metric for programmer productivity?

[Provide your reasons in the itemized list below. Add more items as required. ‚ÄîSS]

<ul>
<li>The result based on this metric is partial because it does not consider the software qualities of the written programs like the reliability, performance, verifiability, maintainability etc.</li>
<li>The ‚Äùfake the rational design process‚Äù is also meaningful for testing a programmer‚Äôs productivity.</li>
<li>The average line of code indicator does not contain any information of the verification. What if
this programmer has a high aver. line. of code while most of these codes have bugs?
</li>
<li>The program‚Äôs productivity should also consider the design and document writing behavior. Be- cause for a programmer, implementing code is only part of his work, while most of the work is to design a good project and writing the corresponding document (SRC, MG, MIS).</li>
<li>‚ÄùPer day‚Äù is absolutely not right. Some people even work during the the weekend while still be low productive. We need a some common assumptions and criterion like working 5 hours in work day for this criterion to work.</li>

Question 2&nbsp; Critique the following requirements specification for a new cell phone ap- plication, called CellApp. Use the following criteria discussed in class for judging the quality of the specification: abstract, unambiguous, and validatable. How could you improve the requirements speci- fication?

‚ÄúThe user shall find CellApp easy to use.‚Äù

[Fill in the itemized list below with your answers. Leave the word in bold at the beginning of each item. ‚ÄîSS]

‚Ä¢ Abstract ‚Äì Not abstract. Because we do not need to name this application ‚ÄúCellApp‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ Unambiguous ‚Äì Ambiguous. Because it doesn‚Äôt define a typical user or the ‚Äúesay to use‚Äù term. ‚Ä¢ Validatable ‚Äì Not validatable. Because an ambiguous program cannot be validatable.

‚Ä¢ How to improve ‚Äì First, ask the client to provide some specific using scenario to help specify the typical user group. Second, measure the ‚Äùeasy to use‚Äù indicator by designing surveys to avoid the subjective and ambiguous judgment by human. Third, we can just call this program ‚Äúproject xxx‚Äù before its releasing to the client to make it more abstract.

Question 3 The following module is proposed for the maze tracing robot we discussed in class (L20). This module is a leaf module in the decomposition by secrets hierarchy.

Module Name find path

Module Secret The data structure and algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.

[Fill in the answers to the questions below. For each item you should leave the bold question and write your answer directly after it. ‚ÄîSS]

A. Is this module Hardware Hiding, Software Decision Hiding or Behaviour Hiding? Why?

It is Software Decision Hiding, because it is both an application data type module (hides imple- mentation of certain variables) and software utility module (hides algorithms used in several other modules).

B. Is this a good secret? Why?

No. The principle is ‚Äùone module one secret‚Äù, however, this module combines data structure and

algorithm together.

C. Does the specification for maze tracing robot require environment variables? If so, which environment variables are needed?

Yes. For example, the file input, the physical button, and the start and end position.

Question 4 Answer the following questions assuming that you are in doing your final year capstone in a group of 5 students. Your project is to write a video game for playing chess, either over the network between two human opponents, or locally between a human and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent.

[Fill in the answers to the questions below. For each item you should leave the bold question and write your answer directly after it. ‚ÄîSS]

<ol>
<li>You have 8 months to work on the project. Keeping in mind that we usually need to fake a rational design process, what major milestones and what timeline for achieving these milestones do you propose? You can indicate the time a milestone is reached by the number of months from the project‚Äôs start date.
<ul>
<li>Requirements (Problem Statement, Development Plan, and SRS) 2-month Note: should also design System VnV Plan during this time</li>
<li>Design (MG and MIS) 2-month

Note: should also design Integration VnV Plan and UnitVnV Plan during this time</li>
<li>Implementation (Code) 1-month</li>
<li>Verification (V&amp;V Report) 2-month</li>
<li>Delivery and Maintenance(prepare for final presentation and fix any errors discovered) 1- month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything in your process should be verified, including the verification. How might you verify your verification?
By Mutation Testing.

<ul>
<li>Generate changes to the source code, called mutants, which become code faults</li>
<li>Mutants include changing an operation, modifying constants, changing the order of execution, etc.</li>
<li>The adequacy of a set of tests is established by running the tests on all generated mutants</li>
<li>The goal is to kill the mutants</li>
</ul>

<li>How do you propose verifying the installability of your game?

Using Virtual Machine to set up different environments or using tools like Docker.</li>

Question 5 As for the previous question, assume you are doing a final year capstone project in a group of 5 students. As above, your project is to write a video game for playing chess, either over the network between two human opponents, or locally between a human and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent. The questions below focus on verification and testing.

[Fill in the answers to the questions below. For each item you should leave the bold question and right your answer directly after it. ‚ÄîSS]

<ol>
<li>Assume you have 4 work weeks (a work week is 5 days) over the course of the project for verification activities. How many collective hours do you estimate that your team has available for verification related activities? Please justify your answer.
Assuming average 2 hours per day and half of days will be consumed for other reasons, then maybe only 20 hours. Because different team members may have personal timelines during this time and the time consumed for the team communication to get everyone understood is also very long.
</li>
<li>Given the estimated hours available for verification, what verification techniques do you recommend for your team? Please list the techniques, along with the number of hours your team will spend on each technique, and the reason for selecting this technique.
<ul>
<li>Continuous Integration Testing. Build a server that can perform regression tests each time the team member push their code. That process will automatically check the code while the code are being implemented, therefore only the initial design and the following maintainance takes time. ‚Äì 10 hours.</li>
<li>Fault Testing. This technology can calculate the exception rate in a black-box way to save our time. ‚Äì 2 hours.</li>
<li>Code Walkthrough. This could guarantee our code‚Äôs reliability by logic checking instead of only empirical testing ‚Äì 8 hours (2 hours at the beginning, 2 in the middle, 4 for the final discussion).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the oracle problem a concern for implementing your game? Why or why not? If it is a concern, how do you recommend testing your software? Yes. Because for a chess game, there is not a winning strategy been discovered currently, and that makes most of the testing hard to validate. (Because you do not know if the AI is playing in the wisdom way). I suggest testing by strategy without an oracle. That is :
<ul>
<li>Parallel testing</li>
<li>By some special cases that can be easier to calculated. For example, the remaining board is proved to has a winning strategy by one player.</li>

Question 8&nbsp; For this question you will implement in Java an ADT for a 1D sequence of real numbers. We want to take the mean of the numbers in the sequence, but as the following web- page shows, there are several different algorithms for doing this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Generalized_mean

Given that there are different options, we will use the strategy design pattern, as illustrated in the following UML diagram:

Figure 1: UML Class Diagram for Seq1D with Mean Function, using Strategy Pattern

You will need to fill in the following blank files: MeanCalculator.java, HarmonicMean.java, QuadraticMean.java, and Seq1D.java. Two testing files are also provided: Expt.java and TestSeq1D.java. The file Expt.java is pre-populated with some simple experiments to help you see the interface in use,

and do some initial testing. You are free to add to this file to experiment with your work, but the file itself isn‚Äôt graded. The TestSeq1D.java is also not graded. However, you may want to create test cases

to improve your confidence in your solution. The stubs of the necessary files are already available in your

src folder. The code will automatically be imported into this document when the tex file is compiled.

You should use the provided Makefile to test your code. You will NOT need to modify the Makefile.

The given Makefile will work for make test, without errors, from the initial state of your repo. The make expt rule will also work, because all lines of code have been commented out. Uncomment lines as

you complete work on each part of the modules relevant to those lines in Expt.java file. As usual, the

final test is whether the code runs on mills. You do not need to worry about doxygen comments.

Any exceptions in the specification have names identical to the expected Java exceptions; your code should use exactly the exception names as given in the spec.

Remember, your code needs to implement the given specification so that the interface behaves as specified. This does NOT mean that the local functions need to all be implemented, or that the types used internally to the spec need to be implemented exactly as given. If you do implement any local functions, please make them private. The real type in the MIS should be implemented by Double (capital D) in Java.
